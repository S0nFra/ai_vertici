# Ai Vertici
“Ai Vertici” is a game from "La settimana enigmistica", an Italian puzzle magazine.

The game involves filling the vertices of the following graph with numbers from 0 to 9, without repetition. The goal is to assign the numbers in such a way that, for all the triangles marked with an "x," the sum of the numbers at the three vertices is the same.

           / \
          / x \
         b --- c
        / \   / \
       / x \ / x \
      d --- e --- f
     / \   / \   / \
    / x \ / x \ / x \
   g --- h --- i --- l
